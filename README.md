# CS 230 Project (VoteU)

**Disclaimer**:
This is a course project for CS 230, offered by the
Lane Computer Science and Electrical Engineering department in the Statler College
of Engineering and Mineral Resources at West Virginia University. If you are not
associated with WVU or have no interest in PHP, you will probably find nothing of
use in this repository.  This is also not a finished product, but instead a purely
visual and easily demonstrable prototype. This product has absolutely no security
measures to prevent open authentication or other potential security issues, and it
runs completely on sandboxed hardware provided by West Virginia University.

All rights are reserved to WVU LCSEE faculty, students, and other project participants
as necessary.

The project specification details a need at a hypothetical university - Morgantown University -
for a general use, ballot based voting system to be used by university users (e.g. students, faculty, staff). The technologies allowed are limited to PHP (5.4.34), MySQL, and
other modern browser technology (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).

This prototype uses the following frameworks:

* [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com) (ver. 2.6.2) - A PHP micro web framework, built for microservices, quick prototypes, and APIs.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) (ver 3.3.5) - An easy-to-use, modern, and fully responsive front-end framework.
* [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) - A quick-to-use templating engine built for PHP.

This README will be updated as the project nears completion.
